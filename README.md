## Social Network

A simple React project that simulates a social network. It stores values in the Redux store, and persists them in the LocalStorage. The data can come from an external API, and there is a boilerplate for that, but it is hardcoded because the purpose of the project is only to deal with the client side. 

The project uses custom hooks, contexts, memoazation, and a lot of generic components that can be used across many places. The project was build With Redux, React-Router and MUI for styling.
